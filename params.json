{"body":"# Tuchus\r\nTuchus is a client-friendly theme for Statamic's backend.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind Tuchus was to take the default Trailhead theme and make it more client-friendly.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* removed the wilderness-themed elements,\r\n* stuck to a monochrome pallette, and \r\n* changed all of the fonts to sans-serif.\r\n\r\nThis is usable in its current state, but I'll probably make some more changes after using it more and, hopefully, hearing some feedback from others.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n#### PC\r\n![Control Panel](tuchus/raw/master/screenshots/control-panel.png)\r\n\r\n![Login](tuchus/raw/master/screenshots/login.png)\r\n\r\n#### Mobile\r\n![Mobile Control Panel](tuchus/raw/master/screenshots/mobile-control-panel.png)\r\n\r\n![Mobile Login](tuchus/raw/master/screenshots/mobile-login.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1.
