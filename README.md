# Tuchus
Tuchus is a client-friendly theme for Statamic's backend.

The idea behind Tuchus was to take the default Trailhead theme and make it more client-friendly.

## Changes
* removed the wilderness-themed elements,
* stuck to a monochrome pallette, and 
* changed all of the fonts to sans-serif.

This is usable in its current state, but I'll probably make some more changes after using it more and, hopefully, hearing some feedback from others.
